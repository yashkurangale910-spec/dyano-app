Each block contains a cryptographic \nhash of the previous block, a timestamp , and transaction data (generally represented as \na Merkle tree , where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains \ninformation about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list \ndata structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently , \nblockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any \ngiven block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks. \nBlockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use \nas a public distributed ledger , where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm \nprotocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are \nnot unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered \nsecure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine \nfault tolerance . \nA blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or \npseudonym ) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for \nbitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber , W. Scott \nStornetta , and Dave Bayer . The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it \nthe first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need for a \ntrusted authority or central server . The bitcoin design has inspired other applications \nand blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by \ncryptocurrencies . The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail . \nPrivate blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the \nmarketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model \" snake \noil \";however , others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, \nmay be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless \nones.","metadata":{"source":"./uploads/samplePDF.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.4","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Untitled document","Producer":"Skia/PDF m131 Google Docs Renderer"},"metadata":null,"totalPages":1},"loc":{"pageNumber":1,"lines":{"from":1,"to":27}}}}]],{"0":"57e58b68-d12f-4e03-99ca-ac742e8e184b"}]
